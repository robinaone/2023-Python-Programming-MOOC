#Please write a program which asks the user for two numbers. 
#The program will then print out the sum and the product of the two numbers.
number1 = int(input("What is the first number? "))
number2 = int(input("What is the second number? "))
print(f"The sum of the numbers: {number1+number2}\nThe product of the numbers: {number1*number2}")

#Sample solution:
#number1 = int(input('Number 1: '))
#number2 = int(input('Number 2: '))
#print("The sum of the numbers:", number1 + number2)
#print("The product of the numbers:", number1 * number2)
