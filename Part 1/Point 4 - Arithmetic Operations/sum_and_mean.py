#Please write a program which asks the user for four numbers. 
#The program then prints out the sum and the mean of the numbers.
number1 = int(input("Please enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Please enter the second number: "))
number3 = int(input("Please enter the third number: "))
number4 = int(input("Please enter the fourth number: "))

print(f"The sum of the numbers is {number1+number2+number3+number4} and the mean is {(number1+number2+number3+number4)/4}")

#Sample solution:
#number1 = int(input('Number 1: '))
#number2 = int(input('Number 2: '))
#number3 = int(input('Number 3: '))
#number4 = int(input('Number 4: '))
#sum = number1 + number2 + number3 + number4
#print(f"The sum of the numbers is {sum} and the mean is {sum/4}")
