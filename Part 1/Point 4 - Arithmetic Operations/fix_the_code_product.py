# Fix the code
#number = int(input("Please type in the first number: "))
#number = int(input("Please type in the second number: "))
#number = int(input("Please type in the third number: "))
#
#product = number * number * number
#
#print("The product is", product)

number = 0
number += int(input("Please type in the first number: "))
number *= int(input("Please type in the second number: "))
number *= int(input("Please type in the third number: "))
print(f"The product is {number}")

#Sample solution given by course:
#number1 = int(input("Please type in the first number: "))
#number2 = int(input("Please type in the second number: "))
#number3 = int(input("Please type in the third number: "))
#
#product = number1 * number2 * number3
#
#print("The product is", product)
