Python Programming MOOC 2023 Part 2 Point 2 Notes
Learning Objectives:
* You will know how to create multiple branches within conditional statements
* You will understand the purpose of IF, ELIF, and ELSE statements within a conditional statement
* You will be able to use the modulo operation % in Boolean expressions

% (MODULO) produces the REMAINDER of an integer division operation

When using an ELSE after an IF, it will result in either one or the other of the options happening.
However, an ELIF will only trigger IF the condition is met, unlike an ELSE, which will just happen if the IF is not met.
